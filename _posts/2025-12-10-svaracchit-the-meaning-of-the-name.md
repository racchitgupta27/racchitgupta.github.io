## The Meaning Behind SvaRacchit

The name I chose, SvaRacchit, is a blend of **Sva (Self)** and **Racchit (Composed/Created)**. This blog is not just a record of places I visit, but a chronicle of the unique insights and reflections gained from making my own path.

Welcome to my self-composed view of the world.
